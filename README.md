# Cubesat

## Introduction

### About CubeSat

A CubeSat serves as a compact yet sophisticated space platform, designed with meticulous engineering to achieve targeted scientific objectives. These miniaturized satellites are crafted with precision and purpose, representing a cost-effective and efficient approach to space exploration. Their primary role revolves around specific scientific, technological, or educational missions. <br>
Equipped with specialized payloads, sensors, and instruments, CubeSats are deployed to gather critical data, monitor phenomena, or conduct experiments in space. These small wonders demonstrate engineering ingenuity, showcasing how intricate systems can be optimized to function flawlessly within a constrained space. Their modular nature allows for versatility, enabling CubeSats to address a diverse array of research goals, from Earth observation to studying cosmic phenomena. <br>
These diminutive pioneers contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the cosmos, proving that innovation can thrive even within the confines of a compact form factor.

### About the project

The project was developed with the goal of creating a mini-satellite that would photograph and film the Earth's curvature at about 30 kilometres above the ground. <br>
In order to reach the altitude of 30 kilometres the CubeSat will be lifted using a helium balloon and returned using a parachute. <br>
The future goal of this project is to reach LEO.
